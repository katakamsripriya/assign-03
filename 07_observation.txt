# Write down your observations and what did you learn new - in this file

Question1
In this question we iterate each list with the help of a for loop and in this for loop we
again use one more loop in which we check if the no of 0's is equal to the number of columns
and if they are equal we append the row number into a new list and retunrn it.

Question 2
In this question we traverse each row with the help of a for loop and then we sort each list
with the help of .sort() function and we append it into a new list and return it.

Question 3
In this question we first convert the given 1-D list into a 2-D list with the help of the shape
given in the question and then we run a for loop till the end of the main list and we take a
variable j=0 and compare the shape with 0 if it is greater we append the list into a new list
and we repeat the process by incrementing j untill whole of the 2-D list is sorted.

Question 4
In this question we first run a for loop on the given input string and then we check for presence
of the given character and if the condition is true we increment the counter and when we c==1
we use .find() method to find the first occurence of the character and then we use strign slicing ro
to swap the occurences of other character around the given character
Question 5
In this question we first take three list say r0 r1 r2 and then we check if the side is left
then we take a variable x=0 and run a for loop on the input nested list and then we append
i[0] i[1] and i[2] to r0 r1 r2 respectively and then we append this sub-list into a new list and
return it
if the side is right we repeat the whole process and then we reverse the list
and return the list
Question 6
In this question we first we run a for loop on the given dict by using d.values and then we stor the
max and min values in two separate variables and then we store there indexes of the
max and min valules in two variables and now append then into a dict and then we use the .get()
function to get key with max and min values.
